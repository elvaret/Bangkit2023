# GlassesFIT 

GlassFIT is a web-based application that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze the user's face shape and provide personalized recommendations for suitable glasses. The main objective is to enhance user confidence in wearing glasses by suggesting styles that complement their face shape. Additionally, the app assists users in locating nearby optical shops and aims to foster collaborations with other businesses in the optical industry. By delivering a comprehensive solution, it seeks to inspire other developers to create innovative applications with additional features, ultimately benefiting a wide range of eyeglass users. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
